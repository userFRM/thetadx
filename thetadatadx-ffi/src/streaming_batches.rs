//! C ABI for the pull-based Arrow `RecordBatch` streaming reader.
//!
//! This is the C-side surface the C++ SDK's `Stream::batches(..)` builds on.
//! It is the sibling of the per-event `thetadatadx_client_set_callback`
//! path: the same subscriptions feed it, but market-data events are pulled
//! as columnar Arrow batches under the fixed streaming schema (see the
//! core `thetadatadx::streaming::stream_batch_schema`) rather than pushed one
//! at a time.
//!
//! # Boundary format
//!
//! Each batch crosses the C ABI as an Arrow IPC stream byte buffer — the
//! same columnar exit the per-tick `thetadatadx_*_to_arrow_ipc` terminals
//! use, so a C++ caller decodes it with arrow-cpp's IPC reader exactly as it
//! already does for market-data results. The fixed schema is available up
//! front as a schema-only IPC buffer so the C++ `arrow::RecordBatchReader`
//! subclass can report `schema()` before the first batch arrives.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! `thetadatadx_client_batches_open` starts the session and returns an
//! opaque handle. `..._next_ipc` blocks for the next batch (releasing no
//! lock the caller holds); a `1` return means clean end of stream.
//! `..._close` signals shutdown through a shared reference, so it is safe to
//! call from another thread WHILE a `..._next_ipc` pull is parked: it wakes
//! the pull (which then returns end of stream) and tears the FPSS session
//! down without taking exclusive ownership. `..._free` releases the handle.
//! It must be serialized with all other entry points for the same handle.
//! Every entry point is wrapped in the panic boundary so no Rust panic
//! crosses `extern "C"`.
//!
//! # Concurrency and handle ownership
//!
//! The reader is held behind an `Arc`, and `..._next_ipc` /
//! `..._schema_ipc` / `..._dropped` each take a short owning clone of that
//! `Arc` for the duration of the call. That clone keeps the core reader alive
//! after the opaque handle has been safely borrowed, but it does not make the
//! handle box itself safe to free concurrently: each entry point must read the
//! `Arc` out of that box before it can clone it. Use `..._close` as the
//! cross-thread wake, wait for or otherwise serialize with any in-flight
//! accessors, then call `..._free`.
