"""ThetaData market-data SDK.

`thetadatadx` provides direct access to ThetaData's real-time and
market-data market data without a separate terminal process. The package
exposes:

- Connection types: :class:`Credentials` and :class:`Config`.
- Clients: :class:`Client` (market-data plus on-demand
  streaming), :class:`AsyncClient` (``await``-based
  market-data), :class:`StreamingClient` (streaming only), and
  :class:`MarketDataClient` (market-data only).
- A fluent subscription surface: :class:`Contract`,
  :class:`Subscription`, and :class:`SecType`.
- Real-time event types delivered to the streaming callback
  (:class:`Quote`, :class:`Trade`, :class:`OpenInterest`,
  :class:`Ohlcvc`, and the connection / lifecycle events).
- A typed exception hierarchy rooted at :class:`ThetaDataError`.
- Utility entry points such as :func:`split_date_range`.

Type checkers discover these annotations through the ``py.typed`` marker
(PEP 561) shipped alongside this file.
