//! Market-data (gRPC) sub-configuration.
//!
//! Holds the per-channel gRPC tuning for the market-data transport:
//! message-size ceiling, keepalive cadence, HTTP/2 flow-control
//! windows, connect/request deadlines, and the buffered-response warn
//! threshold.
//!
//! Channel-pool concurrency is **not** a tuning knob here: it is
//! resolved internally from the subscription tier returned by Nexus
//! auth at connect time, so the live pool always stays inside the
//! server-side per-tier ceiling without any caller input.
//!
//! See `docs-site/docs/configuration.md` for the per-binding setter
//! samples.

/// request, so a live-but-silent server could hang the client forever. Sits
/// above the slowest realistic bulk pull. The per-call
/// `with_deadline(Duration::ZERO)` opt-out is a separate, explicit path and is

/// Policy for automatic sharding of large history pulls — the buffered

///
/// Under `Auto` (the default) the SDK splits a large history pull into
/// equal disjoint sub-requests along a filter axis (a date band or a
/// time band) — cut from the request's own shape, with no sizing query
/// — and runs them across the tier's channel pool.
///
/// The buffered path merges the results into exactly the rows the
/// single stream would have returned. Row order: single-contract,
/// stock, and index pulls keep the exact single-stream order;
/// option-chain pulls come back grouped by
/// `(expiration, strike, right)` ascending — calls before puts,
/// time-ascending within each contract — a deterministic canonical
/// order, because the server enumerates chain contracts in an internal
/// order no client can reproduce.
///
/// The streaming path forwards each band's chunks to the handler as
/// they arrive — no merge, no materialize, so it reaches the full
/// fan-out throughput. Every chunk is delivered exactly once, but
/// chunks from different bands interleave in arrival order rather
/// than the single stream's order; each band of a single-contract /
/// stock / index pull is internally time-ascending. Use the buffered
/// path (which merges) or `Off` when a single-stream order matters.
///
/// Small pulls and non-history endpoints are never sharded, so `Auto`
/// leaves them byte-identical to `Off`.
///
/// `Off` disables the fan-out entirely: every query runs as today's
/// single stream, in the server's own row and chunk order.
