//!
//! `ThetaData` runs two server types in their NJ datacenter:
//!
//! ## Market-data service (market data)
//!
//! Market-data requests connect to a single endpoint over TLS:
//! ```text
//! mdds-01.thetadata.us:443
//! ```
//!
//! ## Streaming service (real-time streaming)
//!
//! Streaming uses a multi-host config with round-robin failover:

//! The connection layer iterates through configured hosts on connection failure.

//! # Layout
//!
//! [`DirectConfig`] is composed of eight nested sub-configs:
//!
//! | Field           | Type                                                |
//! |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `market_data`  | [`MarketDataConfig`] — gRPC host/port/TLS/keepalive       |
//! | `streaming`     | [`StreamingConfig`] — TCP hosts, queue/ring  |
//! | `flatfiles`     | [`FlatFilesConfig`] — FLATFILES retry budget        |
//! | `reconnect`     | [`ReconnectConfig`] — wait cadence + policy         |
//! | `retry`         | [`RetryPolicy`] — exponential backoff for market-data |
//! | `auth`          | [`AuthConfig`] — Nexus URL + `client_type`          |
//! | `metrics`       | [`MetricsConfig`] — Prometheus exporter port        |
//! | `runtime`       | [`RuntimeConfig`] — tokio worker thread sizing      |

///
/// | Variable | Type | Effect |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `THETADATA_MARKET_DATA_TYPE` | `PROD`/`STAGE` | selects the market-data environment + auth marker. Case-insensitive. |
/// | `THETADATA_STREAMING_TYPE` | `PROD`/`DEV` | selects the streaming environment. Case-insensitive. |
/// | `THETADATA_MARKET_DATA_HOST` | host | overrides `market_data.host` |
/// | `THETADATA_MARKET_DATA_PORT` | u16  | overrides `market_data.port` |

/// | `THETADATA_PASSWORD`    | str | credential helper ([`crate::auth`]) |
///
/// The market-data and streaming channels are selected
/// independently: `THETADATA_MARKET_DATA_TYPE` chooses the market-data cluster and the
/// auth marker (production or staging), `THETADATA_STREAMING_TYPE` chooses the
/// streaming cluster (production or dev), and neither affects the other. The
/// typed [`DirectConfig::with_market_data_environment`] /
/// [`DirectConfig::with_streaming_environment`] are the programmatic
/// equivalents.
///
/// The explicit host/port overrides are recorded first and the environments
/// are selected last: selecting an environment rebuilds that channel's routing
/// and then patches the recorded overrides on top, so an explicit
/// `THETADATA_MARKET_DATA_HOST` / `THETADATA_STREAMING_HOST` /
/// `THETADATA_STREAMING_PORT` wins over the environment default while the
/// selected environment's **failover** hosts are preserved. It is independent
/// of the credential — it works the same with either an api-key or an
/// email/password login.
///
/// The "explicit host wins over the environment default" precedence holds
/// for **every** path that sets a host, not only the env-var ordering above.
/// An explicit host survives a later
/// [`DirectConfig::with_market_data_environment`] /
/// [`DirectConfig::with_streaming_environment`] / [`DirectConfig::stage`] /
/// [`DirectConfig::dev`], while the channel's selector (and, for the market-data
/// channel, the auth marker) still flips. This is modelled by **provenance,
/// not value comparison**: the two host fields are encapsulated (a host can
/// only be set through a tracked setter), and each setter records the host as a
/// typed override that environment selection re-applies on top of the selected
/// cluster.
///
/// The host is set the same way regardless of source — the process env, a
/// `.env`, a config file, or the programmatic
/// [`DirectConfig::set_market_data_host`] / [`DirectConfig::set_streaming_hosts`]
/// setters all funnel through the override-recording path, so every source
/// shares one precedence. There is no untracked direct-write path: the fields
/// are crate-private, so environment selection never has to guess whether a
/// field value was a caller edit or a leftover default.
///
/// The streaming override has two tiers — a primary host/port patch (env-var
/// / `.env`) that keeps the environment's failover hosts, and a full explicit
/// host list (the config-file `[streaming] hosts` power-user list, or
/// [`DirectConfig::set_streaming_hosts`]) that wins outright. The full list
/// wins as an explicit choice even when it happens to equal the current
/// environment's own host vector — it is honoured by provenance, never
/// dropped by a value match. A plain `production()` / `stage()` / `dev()` with
/// no override yields that environment's full cluster, unchanged.
///
/// A malformed `THETADATA_MARKET_DATA_PORT` / `THETADATA_STREAMING_PORT` (a
/// non-integer) is ignored with a `tracing::warn!`, keeping the current value.
/// An unrecognized environment selector, by contrast, FAILS LOUD: a
/// `THETADATA_MARKET_DATA_TYPE` that is not `PROD` / `STAGE` (including the now-removed
/// `DEV`) or a `THETADATA_STREAMING_TYPE` that is not `PROD` / `DEV` (including
/// `STAGE`) is a hard error naming the valid set, never a silent fallback, so a
