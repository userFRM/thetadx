//! Exponential-backoff retry policy for transient gRPC errors on the market-data channel.

use std::time::Duration;

/// Exponential-backoff retry policy for transient gRPC errors on the market-data channel.
///
/// Only wired on status codes `Unavailable`, `DeadlineExceeded`, and
/// `ResourceExhausted`. Permission / credential failures route through
/// the separate auto-refresh path and are never retried by this policy.
///
/// # Budget shape
///
/// Two independent stop conditions bound a retry sequence; whichever
/// trips first ends it:
///
/// * `max_attempts` — total attempt count, including the first call.
/// * `max_elapsed` — wall-clock envelope measured from the first
///   attempt. With the default 30 s `max_delay` cap, an attempt-count
///   budget alone is hard to reason about in wall-clock terms;
///   `max_elapsed` lets operators state "retry for up to five minutes"
///   directly. [`Duration::ZERO`] disables the envelope (attempt
///   budget only).
///
/// The defaults (20 attempts, 5 minute envelope) ride through a
/// multi-minute upstream outage: the ladder reaches the 30 s cap at
/// attempt 8 and the envelope cuts the sequence off at five minutes of
/// wall clock.
///
/// # Jitter
///
/// With `jitter = true` (default) the sleep duration follows AWS's
/// *full jitter* pattern: `delay = rand(0, min(max_delay, initial *
/// 2^attempt))`. Full jitter provably minimises retry-storm contention
/// relative to no jitter; see
/// <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/>
/// for the rationale.
///
/// With `jitter = false` the delay is the deterministic backoff
/// `min(max_delay, initial * 2^attempt)`. Useful for tests that
/// need to assert exact timings.
