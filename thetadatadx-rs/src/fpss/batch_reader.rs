//! Pull-based Arrow `RecordBatch` reader over the FPSS stream.
//!
//! [`RecordBatchStream`] is a sibling delivery mode to the per-event
//! callback: instead of pushing one [`StreamEvent`] at a time into a user
//! closure, it pulls the same market-data events out in columnar Arrow
//! batches under the fixed [`super::batch_schema::stream_batch_schema`]. The
//! callback path is unchanged; a caller chooses one or the other per
//! subscription.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! The reader reuses the exact streaming machinery the callback path uses:
//! `client.stream().batches(..).build()` starts FPSS through the same
//! connect / install / dispatcher path as `start_streaming`, but the
//! dispatcher's per-event handler appends each market-data event to a reused
//! [`super::batch_schema::StreamBatchBuilder`] instead of calling user code.
//! The dispatcher flushes a [`RecordBatch`] onto a bounded internal queue
//! whenever the first of these fires:
//!
//! * the builder reaches `batch_size` rows,
//! * `linger` elapses since the first row of the current batch (so a quiet
//!   stream still delivers a partial batch rather than stalling), or
//! * the stream shuts down (a final partial batch is flushed before the
//!   terminal end-of-stream marker).
//!
//! The reader side ([`futures_core::Stream`], the `next_blocking` pull, or the
//! FFI) pulls finished batches off that queue. The queue is always bounded; it
//! never grows without limit.
//!
//! # Backpressure
//!
//! [`Backpressure`] selects what happens when the reader falls behind and
//! the queue fills:
//!
//! * [`Backpressure::Block`] (the default): the dispatcher blocks on a
//!   full queue rather than dropping batches queue-side. This bounds loss
//!   at the reader queue; it does NOT make the pipeline lossless end to
//!   end. Upstream, the I/O thread publishes into the FPSS event ring with
//!   a non-blocking `try_publish` and drops on ring-full by design (in the
//!   `super::ring` module): blocking the I/O thread would stall PING heartbeats
//!   and drop the vendor session on the wire, so it never blocks. A reader
//!   that stalls long enough to back the dispatcher up until the ring
//!   fills therefore loses events at the ring, counted on
//!   [`RecordBatchStream::ring_dropped`] (never on
//!   [`RecordBatchStream::dropped`], which counts only queue-side
//!   `DropOldest` drops).
//! * [`Backpressure::DropOldest`]: the queue is a bounded ring of at most
//!   `capacity` batches; pushing onto a full queue drops the oldest batch
//!   and increments the observable [`RecordBatchStream::dropped`] counter.
//!   The dispatcher never blocks. Drops are counted, never silent.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! Dropping the [`RecordBatchStream`] (or its blocking iterator, or calling
//! [`RecordBatchStream::close`]) stops the FPSS session through the same
//! `stop_streaming` path the callback surface uses, which tears the
//! subscription down and ends the dispatcher. No thread, socket, or
//! subscription leaks.
