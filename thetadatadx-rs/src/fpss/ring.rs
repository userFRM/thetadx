//! Pipeline: blocking TLS `read` -> event ring -> user's
//! `FnMut(&StreamEvent)` callback.
//!
//! No tokio, no channels, no async. The blocking read thread IS the ring
//! producer. Events are pre-allocated in the ring buffer (zero allocation on
//! the hot path), and the single-producer barrier uses a plain store (no CAS).
//!
//! # Publish policy
//!
//! Every publish from the io_loop thread — TLS-read data frames AND
//! handshake / reconnect / control frames — goes through
//! `Producer::try_publish`. The blocking `Producer::publish` is
//! **never** called on the io_loop thread: a slow callback that lets
//! the ring fill must NOT wedge the TLS reader, because a wedged
//! reader stops servicing PING heartbeats and the vendor session
//! drops on the wire. On overflow the event is dropped, the shared
//! `dropped` counter increments, and a `warn` is logged.
//!
//! # Wait Strategy
//!
//! [`AdaptiveWaitStrategy`] carries the selected [`WaitMode`] and drives
//! the consumer's per-empty-poll wait. The default (`Spin`) is the fixed
//! low-latency spin+yield ramp tuned for FPSS tick intervals (~100us
//! during active trading); [`DrainWaiter`] adds the stateful `Backoff`
//! idle escalation on top.
