//! Least-loaded pool of [`Channel`] handles.
//!
//! A single HTTP/2 connection multiplexes many concurrent streams, but
//! every connection carries exactly one connection-level flow-control
//! window and `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` is finite. [`ChannelPool`] keeps
//! `N` parallel channels — one HTTP/2 connection each — and hands them
//! out via [`ChannelPool::next`], picking the channel with the fewest
//! in-flight streams. Spreading concurrent work across several
//! connections gives each its own flow-control window and stream
//! budget, so a saturated stream count on one connection does not
//! throttle the others the way a single multiplexed connection would.
//!
//! The pool is `Arc`-clone-cheap and `Send + Sync`; callers can clone
//! it freely across tasks. Each [`ChannelPool::next`] returns a lease
//! into the pool — the underlying [`Channel`] is owned by the pool as
//! an `Arc<Channel>` and lives as long as the pool does.
//!
//! # Reconnect, in place
//!
//! When an RPC dispatched through a pool channel observes
//! [`super::ChannelError::ConnectionClosed`], the underlying stack
//! lazily replaces the dead HTTP/2 connection on the next dispatch.
//! The pool slot does NOT get marked dead, replaced, or skipped — the
//! same `Arc<Channel>` handle the picker returned remains valid.
