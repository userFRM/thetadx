//! Automatic sharding of large history pulls.
//!
//! One logical query becomes N disjoint sub-requests along a filter
//! axis (date band, time band), dispatched concurrently across the
//! tier's channel pool. Bands are cut from the request shape alone —
//! equal wall-clock duration on the time axis, equal day count on the
//! date axis — never from a sizing query. Balance is equal span, not
//! equal rows: a deliberate trade that costs zero extra round-trips and
//! zero per-endpoint tuning, and the concurrency win dominates the
//! residual row imbalance between bands. The buffered `.await` path merges the shard
//! responses back into exactly the rows the single-stream response would
//! have carried — in the exact server order for single-contract / stock /
//! index pulls, in a deterministic canonical contract order for chains
//! (see `merge_typed_in_order`). The chunk-streaming `.stream*` path forwards
//! each band's chunks to the user handler as they arrive — no merge, no
//! materialize — so chunks from different bands interleave in arrival
//! order (see `join_streaming_shards`). The server's per-account send
//! rate caps a single stream well below the tier's aggregate budget, so
//! the fan-out multiplies bulk throughput without exceeding the tier's
//! concurrent-request ceiling.
//!
//! # Flow (buffered `.await` path)
//!
//! 1. The generated builder assembles its wire parameters once and
//!    projects them into a [`ShardQuery`].
//! 2. `auto_plan` applies the [`BulkFetchPolicy`], the shardable-endpoint
//!    gate, axis selection, and the equal-span band cut — pure
//!    computation, no request issued. Anything that does not clearly
//!    benefit resolves to `None` and runs on today's single stream,
//!    byte-identical.
//! 3. Each [`ShardBand`] is applied onto a clone of the original wire
//!    parameters — every shard is a normal terminal-parity query differing
//!    only in its band fields.
//! 4. Shards run as independent top-level requests (each takes its own
//!    request-semaphore permit), parsing each response chunk into typed
//!    rows as it arrives (`collect_stream_typed` in `mdds/stream.rs` —
//!    the proto rows are never buffered), a band the server reports
//!    empty (`NotFound`) contributes zero rows, and `merge_typed_in_order`
//!    reassembles the output (see its order note).
//!
//! The streaming `.stream*` path shares steps 1–3 verbatim; step 4
//! becomes `join_streaming_shards`, which drives the per-band streams
//! concurrently and forwards chunks instead of joining tables.
//!
//! # Band failure — blast radius
//!
//! A transient band failure recovers per band, inside the band's own
//! retry loop, before either join ever sees it: the buffered path
//! re-fetches the failed band from scratch (its partial collection is
//! attempt-local, nothing reached the caller, so the replay is
//! dedup-free), and a streaming band retries the same way while it has
//! not yet delivered a chunk. Only a band that exhausts its budget (or
//! fails non-retryably) is terminal. On the buffered path that fails
//! the whole query — a merged result missing a band cannot be
//! represented. On the streaming path the siblings DRAIN TO COMPLETION
//! instead of being cancelled — cancelling would truncate them at
//! arbitrary chunk boundaries, leaving ragged half-delivered windows,
//! while draining leaves exactly the failed bands' windows as the known
//! gaps — and the call returns [`crate::Error::PartialShardFetch`]
//! naming those windows so the caller can re-pull precisely the missing
//! slices (see `join_streaming_shards`).
//!
//! # Semaphore safety
//!
//! The joining driver never holds a request permit: each shard acquires
//! its own permit inside its spawned task. Since the semaphore is sized
//! to the channel pool (== tier cap) and a plan never exceeds the pool
//! size, N shards make progress even at `pool_size == 1` (they simply
//! serialize).

/// ranked encoding before value), or `Number` strikes beyond `f64`'s
/// 2^53 integer range — do not occur on the wire: MDDS encodes each

/// row of every shard response of one query carries the same variant,
/// and strikes are dollar-scale. (The cross-band header check pins only
/// column names; variant constancy is that per-endpoint encoding, the
/// same property the single-stream path already relies on.) Were a field
/// to mix variants across shards regardless, the typed key would order
/// it by decoded value — chronological for `expiration`, numeric for
/// `strike` — a more meaningful order than the wire comparator's
/// encoding-first grouping, so the fallback is benign, not a regression.
