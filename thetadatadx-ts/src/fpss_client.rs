//! Standalone TypeScript (napi-rs) `StreamingClient` — streaming only.
//!
//! Opens ONLY the streaming TLS transport, no market-data channel, no Nexus HTTP
//! authentication, no market-data / Treasury / Calendar surface. Mirrors
//! the Python `StreamingClient` (`thetadatadx-py/src/fpss_client.rs`), the C++
//! `thetadatadx::StreamingClient` (`thetadatadx-cpp/include/thetadatadx.hpp`), and the standalone
//! C ABI entry points (`thetadatadx_client_*` in `thetadatadx-ffi/src/streaming.rs`), letting a
//! Node.js caller run a streaming-only session alongside an externally
//! managed market-data process without the bundled
//! [`crate::Client`] preempting the parallel market-data work at the
//! Nexus session layer.
//!
//! # Why a hand-written module
//!
//! The unified [`crate::Client`] drives the high-level
//! `thetadatadx::Client::start_streaming` convenience, which
//! owns its own dispatcher thread and `DispatcherSession`. The standalone
//! client wraps `thetadatadx::fpss::StreamingClient` directly — the lower-level
//! streaming primitive that exposes `for_each_scoped` / `subscribe` / `shutdown`
//! but no dispatcher management — so this module spins the dispatcher
//! thread itself, exactly as the Python and C ABI standalone clients do.
//! The event-delivery path is the same `ThreadsafeFunction` mechanism the
//! unified TS streaming uses: the dispatcher thread converts each event to
//! the typed napi object and routes it onto the Node main thread.
//!
//! # Nexus session behaviour
//!
//! This client does NOT issue a Nexus authentication. The streaming service speaks its own
//! protocol-level `CREDENTIALS` handshake on the TLS connection itself; no
//! separate Nexus session is acquired. Run the bundled
//! [`crate::Client`] when you need the market-data surface and Nexus
//! session machinery side by side.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. `StreamingClient.connect(...)` / `connectFromFile(...)` — snapshots the
//!    connect parameters. The streaming TLS connection is opened lazily by
//!    `startStreaming` (matching the FFI's deferred-connect contract).
//! 2. `startStreaming(callback)` — opens the streaming TLS connection and
//!    starts the background dispatcher driving the ring iterator.
//! 3. `subscribe(...)` / `unsubscribe(...)` — fluent subscription.
//! 4. `stopStreaming()` / `shutdown()` — atomic stop with drain barrier.
//! 5. `reconnect()` — re-open under the same callback.

/// # Mechanism
///
/// The returned hook clones the function's shared
/// [`ThreadsafeFunctionHandle`](napi::threadsafe_function::ThreadsafeFunctionHandle)
/// (the `handle` field is an `Arc` shared by every clone of the function,
/// including the one the blocked consumer holds) and performs the same abort
/// the framework's deprecated [`ThreadsafeFunction::abort`] performs, but in a
/// lock order that can wake a blocked caller: it releases the underlying napi
/// threadsafe function with
/// [`ThreadsafeFunctionReleaseMode::abort`](napi::sys::ThreadsafeFunctionReleaseMode).
/// N-API then makes a blocked `call(.., Blocking)` return
/// [`napi::Status::Closing`], dropping napi-rs's `aborted` read guard. Only
/// after that wake is sent does the hook take the write lock and mark the
/// shared `aborted` flag, so future calls reject immediately.
///
/// The replicated-abort form is used in preference to calling the deprecated
/// `abort()` because `abort()` consumes `self` by value, which is impossible
/// from a shared `Arc<TsfnCallback>` (the blocked consumer co-owns it). A
/// per-hook once flag makes a repeated wake attempt a harmless no-op even if
/// the hook is ever wrapped behind a replayable teardown adapter.
///
/// # When it runs
///
/// Teardown installs this as the session's `on_teardown` and runs it through
/// [`join_dispatcher_with_wake`], which fires it only as a FALLBACK — after the
/// dispatcher fails to exit on its own within the grace window. The abort is
/// permanent (a later `call` returns `Closing` forever) and `reconnect` re-uses
/// the same function, so firing it on every stop would break a reconnected
/// session; gating it behind the grace fires it only when it is the sole way to
/// break a real deadlock.

mod teardown_deadlock_tests {
    //! Deterministic watchdog for the bounded-queue teardown deadlock.
    //!
    //! The bug: the per-event dispatcher hands each event to a napi
    //! [`crate::TsfnCallback`] via a `Blocking`
    //! [`call`](napi::threadsafe_function::ThreadsafeFunction::call) against a
    //! bounded call queue. Once the queue fills, the dispatcher blocks INSIDE
    //! `call` waiting for the Node main thread to drain it. A synchronous
    //! teardown (`stopStreaming`, or a drop that runs on the JS thread) can run
    //! on that same Node main thread and JOIN the dispatcher, so the main
    //! thread is parked in the join and can never drain the queue: the blocked
    //! `call` never returns, the dispatcher never exits, and the join hangs
    //! forever.
    //!
    //! The fix gives the dispatcher an `on_teardown` wake hook
    //! ([`super::abort_hook`]) that aborts the threadsafe function so the
    //! in-flight `Blocking` `call` returns [`napi::Status::Closing`]; the
    //! consumer then resumes, observes the client shutdown, exits its loop, and
    //! the join completes. The teardown fires the hook only as a FALLBACK, via
    //! [`super::join_dispatcher_with_wake`]: a dispatcher that exits on its own
    //! within the grace window is joined WITHOUT the hook running, so the
    //! (permanent, function-killing) abort does not fire on a session that
    //! `reconnect` will re-use. Only a dispatcher still blocked off the ring
    //! after the grace gets the hook.
    //!
    //! These tests drive the REAL [`super::join_dispatcher_with_wake`] against a
    //! stand-in for the napi abort primitive — a real `ThreadsafeFunction`
    //! cannot be built off-thread without a napi `Env`, which the test runner
    //! lacks, so the stand-in mirrors the shape that matters:
    //! [`napi::threadsafe_function::ThreadsafeFunctionHandle`]'s bounded queue
    //! plus a shared `aborted` flag whose write path mirrors `abort_hook`
    //! exactly, and a `call` that returns `Closing` the instant `aborted` is
    //! set. A [`Barrier`] makes the consumer DETERMINISTICALLY blocked-in-`call`
    //! before teardown runs, and an [`AtomicBool`] + deadline loop is the
    //! watchdog. The trio below pins all three properties: the blocked dispatcher
    //! is released and the join completes (the fix); with NO hook the same
    //! scenario hangs (the harness genuinely reproduces the bug); and a cleanly
    //! exiting dispatcher is joined without the hook firing (reconnect re-use is
    //! preserved).
