# ThetaDataDx Live Option Chain

Real-time option chain viewer powered by ThetaDataDx's native Rust SDK.
No JVM required --- connects directly to ThetaData servers via the
`thetadatadx` Python bindings.

## What it looks like

A full-width Streamlit dashboard with:

- **Sidebar**: credentials, ticker input, display controls, Greeks parameters
- **Tabs**: one per expiration (nearest 12 shown), labeled with date and DTE
- **Option chain table**: calls on the left, strike in the center, puts on the right
- **Color coding**: ITM cells tinted green, ATM strike highlighted gold
- **Columns**: IV, Delta, Gamma, Theta, Bid, Ask, Last, Volume, OI
- **Auto-refresh**: configurable 2--30 second polling interval

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.
